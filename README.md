# Dogs_Breed_Classification

## This is a Dogs_Breed_Classification Deep Learning Model.

## Specifications:

1. Image Processing techniques such as Resizing, Rescaling, Reading, Standardizing etc. are used in the project.
2. The model is designed using RESNET50 Deep Learning Architecture.
3. The target classes to be predicted are: : beagle, chihuahua, doberman,french_bulldog, golden_retriever, malamute, pug, saint_bernard, scottish_deerhound,tibetan_mastiff.
4. The model is implemneted using Tensorflow and Keras Frameworks.
5. The implemenetd Deep learning Model is evaluated on measuring metrics such as Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC Score and F1-Score.
6. Also, a classification report is generated that documents an anaysis of individual classes against various metrics.
